1.	Copy all the files into your DocumentRoot-folder.

2.	Modify following files by changing usernames and passwords:
	inc/pam/imap			MySQL
	inc/config.inc.php4		MySQL, Cyrus
	inc/database.sql		Cyrus, first user with superuser-rights.
	samples/hsys_mail.daimon.php4	MySQL
	Create the required MySQL users.

3.	Copy samples/pam/imap settings to your /etc/pam.d folder
	    chmod 600 samples/pam/imap
	    cp samples/pam/imap /etc/pam.d/imap
	    cp /etc/pam.d/imap  /etc/pam.d/pop
	    cp /etc/pam.d/imap  /etc/pam.d/sieve
	    cp /etc/pam.d/imap  /etc/pam.d/smtp
	(I assume you have configured SASL to utilize pam:
	 In /etc/sysconfig/saslauthd:   SASLAUTHD_AUTHMECH=pam
	 And have compiled and copied pam_mysql.so to /lib/security)

4.	Create an empty MySQL-Databse and execute database.sql within.
	Don't forget to modify it before you do that.

5.	For security reasons remove these files from your DocumentRoot-folder:
	    rm -r samples/pam
	    rm inc/database.sql
	    rm samples/hsys_mail.daimon.php4 samples/postfix

In case you intend running this as demo, replace inc/cyrdam.php with inc/fake-cyradm.php:
	rm inc/cyrdam.php && ln -s inc/fake-cyradm.php inc/cyrdam.php
