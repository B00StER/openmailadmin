= Quick Install Guide =
If this is your first installation, please read this carefully first:
  http://www.openmailadmin.org/wiki/Documentation/Installation/Detailed

This guide omits integration with your existing MDA and MTA.

== Step 1 ==
Copy all the files into your '''DocumentRoot'''-folder.

== Step 2 ==
Point your browser to setup.php.
You will have to comment out the first line in setup.php.

== Step 3 ==
Modify following files by changing '''usernames and passwords''':
 * samples/pam/imap
And either of these:
 * samples/postfix/*
 * samples/oma_mail.daimon.*

== Step 4 ==
Copy samples/pam/imap settings to your /etc/pam.d folder
{{{
 chmod 600 samples/pam/imap
 cp samples/pam/imap /etc/pam.d/imap
 ln -s /etc/pam.d/imap  /etc/pam.d/pop
 ln -s /etc/pam.d/imap  /etc/pam.d/sieve
 ln -s /etc/pam.d/imap  /etc/pam.d/smtp
}}}

We assume you have configured [http://asg.web.cmu.edu/sasl/ SASL]
to utilize [http://pam-mysql.sourceforge.net/ pam_mysql].

== Step 5 ==
For security reasons, remove these files from your DocumentRoot-folder:
{{{
 rm -r samples/pam
 rm samples/oma_mail.daimon.* samples/postfix
}}}
Don't forget removing comment in setup.php!

'''Done! '''
